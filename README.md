[![Browser Extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Browser-Extension-blue.svg)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore)

A browser extension that helps you maintain focus by hiding distracting sections on social media platforms and providing smart redirects to more meaningful content. Currently supports **Chromium-based browsers** (Chrome, Edge, Brave) with plans to expand to Firefox and Safari.

## Features

- **Element Hiding**: Hide distracting sections using precision XPath selectors
- **Intelligent Redirects**: Automatically redirect to focused content (e.g., YouTube subscriptions instead of homepage)
- **Auto-Click Actions**: Automatically click elements after hiding (e.g., switch to "Following" tab on Twitter)
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Twitter/X, LinkedIn, YouTube, Reddit with dynamic platform detection
- **Persistent Settings**: User preferences saved across browser sessions
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintainable, testable, and extensible codebase
- **Performance Optimized**: Debounced DOM operations and smart mutation observers

## Browser Support

**Currently Supported:**

- Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Brave Browser
- Other Chromium-based browsers

**Coming Soon:**

- Firefox (WebExtensions compatibility layer in development)
- Safari (planned for future release)

            "name": "YouTube - Home to Feed Redirect",
            "platform": "youtube",
            "currentPath": "/",

## Development

### Build System

The project uses a sophisticated build system supporting both development and production modes:

#### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Uses ES modules for easier debugging
- Includes DEV mode indicator in popup
- Live reload friendly
- Uses `popup-template.html` â†’ `popup.html`

#### Production Mode

```bash
npm run prod
```

- Bundles modules into single files for compatibility
- Removes dev indicators for clean UI
- Optimizes for distribution
- Creates `content-bundled.js` and `popup-bundled.js`

### Available Scripts

| Command                   | Purpose           | Output                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`             | Development setup | Modular files, dev indicators |
| `npm run build`           | Production build  | Bundled files, optimized      |
| `npm run clean`           | Reset to dev mode | Removes bundled files         |
| `npm run rebuild`         | Clean + build     | Fresh production build        |
| `npm run package:chrome`  | Chrome package    | ZIP file for Chrome store     |
| `npm run package:firefox` | Firefox package   | ZIP file for Firefox store    |
| `npm run lint`            | Code linting      | ESLint check                  |
| `npm run format`          | Code formatting   | Prettier formatting           |

### Adding New Features

#### 1. New Platform Support

Simply add to `config.json`:

```json
{
    "id": "newplatform_section",
    "name": "New Platform: Section Name",
    "platform": "newplatform",
    "xpaths": ["//xpath/selector"]
}
```

#### 2. New Business Logic

Add new functionality by:

1. Creating entities in `src/domain/entities/`
2. Adding services to `src/domain/services/`
3. Implementing use cases in `src/application/usecases/`
4. Adding infrastructure in `src/infrastructure/`
5. Updating presentation controllers in `src/presentation/`

### Code Quality

The project maintains high code quality through:

- ESLint configuration for consistent code style
- Prettier for automatic code formatting
- Clean Architecture principles
- Comprehensive documentation
- Type safety through JSDoc comments
